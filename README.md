# â›µ Argo

_Compatible with [GraphQL October 2021 Edition](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021)._ View [Argo on GitHub](https://github.com/msolomon/argo).

**Argo is a compact and compressible binary serialization format for** [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).
It aims to:

- **Minimize end-to-end latency** of GraphQL responses
  - Including serialization, transport, and deserialization
- **Minimize bytes on the wire**, with and without external compression
- Be **easy to implement**

Argo\:

- **Takes the place of JSON** in GraphQL responses
- Usually **meets the needs of mobile clients** (and server clients) better than web clients
- **Works best with code generation**, but also works well with interpretation
- Does not currently support [GraphQL Input types](#sec-GraphQL-input-types)

Compressed **Argo responses are typically 5%-15% smaller** than corresponding compressed JSON responses.

Uncompressed **Argo responses are typically 50-80% smaller** than corresponding JSON responses.
